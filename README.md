# Cypress testing project

Hi,
this is a sample cypress project that contains two spec files located in integration folder.

- pricing.spec.ts
- signIn.spec.ts

Your task is to read instructions in each file and write some tests.
How many depends on you, but it should cover the basic functionality.

We use Cypress library for the testing, so I guess https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress.html will be helpful.

How to make it work:

1) Install using
```
npm install
```

2) Tests can be run using
```
npm test
```

That's all :)

Good luck!
